Carpet tastes like red,
Lampshade flying, bed is dead,
Butterflies eat lead.

Guitar barks at moon,
Banana wears a raccoon,
Cheese left out till June.

Raindrops meow slow,
Mountains skip, rivers throw,
Jelly beans don't row.

Chicken socks on toast,
Sunrise eats a ghost,
Salad fears the most.

Book reads a person,
Fishes baking in the sun,
Mirror says, "Run, bun!"

Stapler chews the rug,
Watermelon barks at jug,
Spoon hugs coffee mug.

Tree dances with broom,
Clocks sing to a dirty room,
Carpet eats perfume.

Fridge walks to the park,
Socks chat with a neon shark,
Darkness barks, "Hark, hark!"

Potato flies kite,
Chairs play chess all through the night,
Lemons out of sight.

T-shirt tells a joke,
Pillows filled with diet coke,
Clouds wear a cloak.

Chair sit, floor is hapy,
Bird fly with no wing,
Pizza sleeps in cup.

Sun is cold, ice hot,
Fish walking on the street,
Shoe sing to the cloud.

Ball roll up the hill,
Book read itself yesterday,
Trees whisper loud wrong.

Moon bright in morning,
Sunset at noon, stars play card,
Grass wear blue glasses.

Tea drink the human,
Bike ride itself to the sea,
Clouds jump over moon.

Evening's gentle sigh,
Moonlight dances on the tide,
Peace floods the shoreline.

Whispers of autumn,
Leaves carpet the silent path,
Gold beneath my feet.

Winter's breath so crisp,
Snowflakes in symmetrical grace,
Silence cloaks the earth.

Spring’s first blush unfurls,
Cherry blossoms tender bloom,
New beginnings stir.

Summer’s vibrant hum,
Meadows rich with life's chorus,
Sunset paints the sky.

Stardust veils the lake,
Night whispers to the cosmos,
Eternal embrace.

Mountains hold the dawn,
Mist parts for the sun’s soft kiss,
Earth sighs in light’s warmth.

Ancient forest dreams,
Moss whispers old earth secrets,
Time breathes through the leaves.

Desert under stars,
Silence speaks in silver tones,
Infinity’s pulse.

Ocean’s heart pulses,
Waves murmur of moonlit paths,
Souls sail beyond horizons.

Rain falls on the street,
Umbrellas bloom like flowers,
Puddles mirror skies.

Sunset fades to gray,
City lights flicker awake,
Night covers the day.

Leaves rustle softly,
A breeze stirs the quiet park,
Squirrels dart and play.

Morning dew sparkles,
Birds chirp in a modest tune,
Day breaks with a yawn.

Stars peek through the clouds,
A lone owl calls in the dark,
Night gently whispers.

Coffee in the dawn,
Morning yawns over the town,
Work starts too early.

Clouds drift aimlessly,
A lazy sun hides behind,
Day like any other.

Trees sway just a bit,
A breeze that feels quite normal,
Nothing much to see.

The road stretches on,
Cars pass with a muted hum,
Rhythms of routine.

Night settles softly,
Moon appears, not too bright,
Sleep comes, just on time.
